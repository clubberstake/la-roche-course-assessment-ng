## Required Software
1. Install node: 
* If you are on windows or Mac, follow installer from here -> https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* If you are on Ubuntu, follow this instructions here -> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04. Specifically, the section titled, "How To Install Using a PPA".
* Node let's us install libraries and software packages
* Some we use to work with the project, some are libraries used by the code.
2. Navigate to the LaRocheChemAssessment/angularApp (master) folder. Run these commands:
* npm install
* npm install -g @angular/cli

## Run the development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Create a new component 

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
